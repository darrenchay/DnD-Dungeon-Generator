I assert that this work is my own. I have appropriately acknowledged
any and all material (data, images, ideas or words) that I have used,
whether directly quoted or paraphrased. Furthermore, I certify that
this assignment was prepared by me specifically for this course.

Design Improvements
1) Since the class door has a high level of cohesion, maybe trying to use another way to connect the 2 spaces which doesn't make all classes dependent on that class would be better 
2) Instead of having to input a string as a constructor for the passage section class, it would be easier if we used an integer which will be used as encoding for a specific passage section type instead. This prevents errors that could arise if the user makes a mistake when inputting the String.
